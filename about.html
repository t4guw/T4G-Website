                <h2>About Tech For Good Research Group </h2>
                Tech for Good had its inaugural year Fall of 2019. What started off with students doing Leetcode problems as independent study evolved into an interest in how students learn and succeed in computer science. Past projects have included machine learning,
                AI, games with a purpose.

                    <h2>Dr. Wanda Gregory</h2>
                    I am a bit of a hybrid having worked in the game industry for companies including Sierra Online, Wizards of the Coast, Hasbro and Microsoft before teaching at the University of Washington Bothell courses in game and interactive media design and media
                    studies. In all my classes I find ways to integrate my professional and academic background to students. The focus of my research is finding new ways through games, avatars and technology (AI, virtual reality, wearables) to help transform
                    health and medicine.
                    <br><br> In addition to my teaching and work in industry, I have served on the board of trustees for organizations including: Cornish School of the Arts, On the Boards, Powerful Voices and Reel Girls. I also serve as an advisor for
                    several technology and educational startups and labs.
                    <br><br> My current research focuses on the use of games, and game technologies to create immersive experiences in the management of pain and stress reduction. I also explore the possible intersections between technology, neuroscience,
                    and consciousness studies.
                    <br><br> When not teaching or mentoring, I can be found creating VR meditative spaces or in the UK studying cultural and archeaoastronomy.
