                <ol>
                    <li>Check your eligibility for CSS 497. Check whether I am a good fit to supervise your capstone
                        (completed a course with me, topic in my research area, etc). Have a look at the abstracts from
                        students whom I have supervised.</li>
                    <li>Explore capstone project options and talk to CSS 497 coordinator if necessary</li>
                    <li>If you are doing a faculty research, you will need to pick one of the projects from my capstone
                        projects or one of the projects that the Tech for Good research group is already working on. For
                        internship based capstones, skip the next couple of steps and send me the CSS 497 contract.</li>
                    <li>Send me an email with a 1-3 paragraph description of your project OR your thoughts on how you
                        can
                        contribute to one of the existing projects OR if you do not have a project idea a list of areas
                        you are interested in and description of what areas you are good at. Describe the benefits of
                        the proposed project (e.g., ‘What is this project going to accomplish?’) and the academic merit
                        of proposed project (e.g. ‘How will the project help you develop your core and advanced
                        technical
                        competencies). Specify at least 3 dates/times you can meet. Include a copy of your unofficial
                        transcript.</li>
                    <li>Have a meeting to discuss the project</li>
                    <li>Download “CSS 497 Contract”, fill it and sent it to me via email.</li>
                    <p>Choose CR/NC as the grade</p>
                    <p>Project plan must include a schedule with deliverables. It is not mandatory that you meet the
                        schedule precisely, but you should have a plan before you start. Your plan should encompass 400
                        hours of work.</p>
                    <p>Method and Criteria for Evaluation must include: Deliverables to your sponsor (if any), Regular
                        reports, Colloquium slides + poster, Colloquium Abstract and Successful completion of the CSS
                        colloquium.</p>

                <h3 class="topic">Reports</h3>
                <p>Submit weekly progress reports for faculty research, fortnightly progress reports for all other
                    capstones. All reports should be submitted via Canvas when possible and have</p>

                </ol>
                <p>A research based report will have:</p>

            <div class="steps">
                <p>Other capstone project will have varying reports, but along the lines below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Deliverables (pseudocode, code, requirement spec, design spec, testing plans, testing results,
                        diagrams, discussion, web site or something else that is appropriate for your capstone)</li>
                    <li>Reflection
                        <p>What did you learn? What do you wish you would have learned?</p>
                        <p>How did you enjoy what you’re doing?</p>
                        <p>Things that went well? Things that didn’t go well? Things you would change if you did it
                            over?</p>
                        <p>Was the mentoring handled well? Why or why not?</p>
                        <p>What were the challenges in your project? Did you have to communicate with non-technical
                            people? If so, how did it go?</p>
                        <p>Problems? Cool things?</p>
                        <p>Would you like to continue working at your internship company? Why or why not?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>As long as you are working as a researcher, intern or on your project, you need to keep
                        submitting reports. Once you are done working, and only have the colloquium, then you do not
                        need to submit reports.</li>
                    <li>We will also have some meetings either face-to-face or via Zoom/Skype. For faculty research,
                        this will be approximately once a month. For all other capstones, this will be every other
                        month.
                        If your capstone is only 1-quarter, we’ll adjust this schedule. You must attend at least one CSS
                        Colloquium prior to your own presentation. Record the colloquium dates in your calendar. If you
                        have not attended a previous colloquium, you will not be allowed to present.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="steps">
                <h3 class="topic">Colloquium</h3>
                <p>The typical schedule for colloquium is 11:30-12:30 poster presentations followed by 1:00-4:00 for
                    oral presentations. This can change, so make sure you watch for emails from capstone coordinator.
